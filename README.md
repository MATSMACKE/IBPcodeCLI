# IB Pcode CLI

A tool to translate IB Pseudocode to JavaScript.

## Credit:

This tool is adapted from [Dave Mulkey's original EZ Pseudocode tool](http://ibcomp.fis.edu/pseudocode/pcode.html) to run as a command line interface in Node.js.

## Requirements:
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Usage:

Rename `pcode-cli-yourOS-yourCPUarchitecture` to `pcode-cli`.

Make sure pcode file (`.pseudo` to allow VS Code syntax highlighting) is in the same folder as `pcode-cli`.

Open a Terminal to that folder.

Run: `./pcode-cli your_file_name` or use the extension

## Recommended:
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a code editor with integrated terminal.
